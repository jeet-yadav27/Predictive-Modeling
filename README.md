# Predictive-Modeling


##Probelm 1
The comp-activ database comprises activity measures of computer systems. Data was gathered from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory, operating in a multi-user university department. Users engaged in diverse tasks, such as internet access, file editing, and CPU-intensive programs.  

Being an aspiring data scientist, you aim to establish a linear equation for predicting 'usr' (the percentage of time CPUs operate in user mode). Your goal is to analyze various system attributes to understand their influence on the system's 'usr' mode.  

##Problem 2  
the Republic of Indonesia Ministry of Health, a dataset containing information from a Contraceptive Prevalence Survey. This dataset encompasses data from 1473 married females who were either not pregnant or were uncertain of their pregnancy status during the survey.  

Task involves predicting whether these women opt for a contraceptive method of choice. This prediction will be based on a comprehensive analysis of their demographic and socio-economic attributes.
